	// if err != nil { // if an error occurs 
	// 	// In this example, if gorm.Open fails to  clonnect to the database, the function will panic, printing the error message and stopping the execution of the program.
	// 	panic(err)  // panic is called, it immediately stops the execution of the function in which it was called and begins to unwind the stack, running any deferred functions along the way. If the panic is not recovered, it eventually stops the entire program. The statement panic(err) is commonly used to handle unexpected errors where the program cannot (or should not) continue its execution. Here's a basic breakdown:   err: This represents an error value. In Go, error handling is usually done by returning an error type as the last value in a function's return list. If an error is not nil, it indicates that something went wrong.  panic(err): This line triggers a panic with the error err. It's often used in situations where the error is critical and there is no way for the program to recover or proceed further. For example, if your program absolutely needs to read a configuration file to start, and it can't find that file, you might use panic to halt the program.
