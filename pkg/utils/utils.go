// The ParseBody function in the provided utils package is designed to parse the JSON payload from the body of an HTTP request and unmarshal it into a Go data structure. The function accepts two parameters:

func Parsebody(r *http.Request, x interface{}){
	if body, err :=  io.ReadAll(r.Body); err == nil {
		if err := json.Unmarshal([]byte(body), x); err != nil {
			return
		}
	}
}

// r *http.Request: This is a pointer to the http.Request object which contains all the information about the incoming HTTP request, including the request body.

// x interface{}: This is an empty interface that can accept any type. In the context of this function, x is expected to be a pointer to a struct that corresponds to the expected JSON payload structure.

// Here's a step-by-step explanation of what the function does:

// ioutil.ReadAll(r.Body): This reads all the data from r.Body, which is an io.ReadCloser that contains the request's body. The ReadAll function reads until an error or EOF (end of file) and returns the data it read. In this case, it returns a byte slice ([]byte) containing the body's content and an error (err). If there is an error while reading the body, it will not be nil.

// if body, err := ioutil.ReadAll(r.Body); err == nil {: This line is checking if the error returned from ReadAll is nil, which means that the reading of the body was successful. If it's successful, it proceeds with the body variable now containing the raw byte slice of the request body.

// if err := json.Unmarshal([]byte(body), x); err != nil {: This line attempts to unmarshal the JSON from the body byte slice into the struct pointed to by x. The json.Unmarshal function takes a byte slice and a pointer to the struct where you want the JSON to be decoded into.

// return: If json.Unmarshal encounters an error (e.g., if the body does not contain valid JSON or doesn't match the struct pointed to by x), the function will simply return. It doesn't handle the error; it ignores it. This could be a potential issue if you need to handle the error appropriately, such as sending back an HTTP error response.

// One thing to note is that this function uses ioutil.ReadAll, which is fine, but since Go 1.16, it's recommended to use io or os packages directly as ioutil has been deprecated. The io.ReadAll function is the new recommended approach:
